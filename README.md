# Machine Learning

### Machine Learning exercises for my subject of Machine Learning (Aprendizaje Autom√°tico) at University of Granada (UGR) of 2015/2016.

This repository contents Machine Learning exercises divided by sections, corresponding to the exercises of the subject. Each folder contents the R code and a R-markdown that you can use on [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio) and see the results of the exercises, edit the content, etc. Also, a PDF is included (in Spanish) with the results and conclusions of the differents exercises.

## 1. Perceptron and linear regression 

Here, I implemented a linear perceptron, pocket perceptron and linear regression, and they are tested with random generated data to see how perceptrons and regressions works.

## 2. Linear methods, overfitting and regularization

Here, I implemented differents linear methods:

* __Gradient descent__, also known as __steepest descent__.
* __Coordinate descent__.
* __Newton method__.
* __Logistic regression__.

Also, there are implementations to measure the overfitting of the model, apply regularization to a model, weight decay, etc and model selection according to their perfomance.

## 3. Generalized linear models, SVM, KNN and Trees

In this section, I followed the book [ An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) (ISLR), and do different exercise with generalized linear models, Support Vector Machine, KNN, Boosting, Bagging, Random Forest and Trees... and different dataset.
